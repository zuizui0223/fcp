# FCP — within-species flower-colour variation

This repository contains the current **New Phytologist** manuscript and reproducible analysis for a comparative study of within-species flower-colour variation.

The study asks three linked questions:

1. Can repeated community-science photographs recover a reproducible species-level flower-colour phenotype?
2. Does continuous within-species colour displacement repeatedly align along a common achromatic–chromatic axis across species?
3. Is the amount of within-species colour diversity associated with stronger geographic colour organization?

The active manuscript keeps measurement validation, prospective confirmation, geographic structure, and environmental follow-up analyses as distinct inferential layers.

## Current evidence surface

The manuscript uses high-depth, species-level repeated photographs with location-blind colour measurement and observer-disjoint validation. Four-state diversity is summarized by Gini–Simpson D; a finite-sample-corrected sensitivity leaves species rankings and the main D–spatial conclusions essentially unchanged. A species-disjoint prospective cohort tests a pre-frozen white-versus-nonwhite colour-space axis under a construction-preserving null. Secondary evidence is bounded but now spans mechanism layers: published *S. littorea* RNA-seq/HPLC provides a quantitative F3h1/Myb1a anchor for one PAL system, PAL/WAL persistence tables provide a frequency contrast, and an observer-sensitive BIO5 signal does not transport as a common cross-cohort rule. The prospective cohort uses new species and photographs but remains within the same iNaturalist source and measurement system, so it is not an independent-source replication.

The 42,111-species metadata frame is an **opportunity frame**, not a denominator for global polymorphism prevalence. Claims are controlled by the frozen machine-readable results, protocols, claim ledger, and data-lineage map linked above.

## Reproducibility boundary

Repository organization must not alter frozen numerical results, biological decision rules, immutable source commits, or checksums. When prose and machine-readable artifacts differ, the authority order in [`CURRENT_PAPER_REPRODUCIBILITY.md`](CURRENT_PAPER_REPRODUCIBILITY.md) applies.
